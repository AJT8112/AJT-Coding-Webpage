                    <p> Aside from working part-time throughout my education both at school and University, my full-time professional career began following the completion of my BSc in Microbiology. I moved from a life in the East Midlands up to Barnard Castle in the North East, working for a pharmaceutical company called GSK in their Microbiology Department. I learned a great amount in this role with regards to work ethic and project working using site and company wide procedures, whilst also fine-tuning my verbal and written communication to achieve goals.</p>
                    <p> In December 2019 I decided to leave Barnard Castle to follow my passion of travelling the world with intentions of exploring the Southern Hemisphere, which began with New Zealand. Follwoing 6 weeks of travelling boht Islands of New Zealand I returned home following the restrictions caused by the pandemic in which I had time to plan my future career.</p>
                    <p> The next step in my professional life was that I followed my interest to work with people and benefit society, and so I completed a PGCE in Secondary School Science, allowing me to teach the Sciences (biology, chemistry and physics) in secondary schools. This career was extremely intrinsically rewarding and I thoroughly enjoyed working and building the future generations. Whilst completing my PGCE I helped out in a Technology week in which I first was exposed to coding in the form of 'Scratch'.</p>
                    <p> Following this introduction to very very basic coding I have had a massive interest in understanding coding and the tech industry, building a custom PC and completing courses in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My long term plan is to build a successful software developing career with the end goal of being able to spread and impress a strong knowledge and passion in software development for future generations.</p>
