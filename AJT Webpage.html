                <div class="amText">
                    <p> Following working part-time throughout my education both at school and University, my full-time professional career began after the completion of my BSc(Hons) in Microbiology. I moved from a life in the Midlands up to Barnard Castle, located in the North East, working for a pharmaceutical company called GSK in their Microbiology Department. I learned a great amount in this role with regards to work ethic and project working using site and company wide procedures, whilst also fine-tuning my verbal and written communication to achieve goals.</p>
                    <p> In December 2019 I decided to leave Barnard Castle to follow my passion of travelling the world with intentions of exploring the Southern Hemisphere, which began with New Zealand. Follwoing 6 weeks of travelling boht Islands of New Zealand I returned home following the restrictions caused by the pandemic in which I had time to plan my future career.</p>
                    <p> The next step in my professional life was that I followed my interest to work with people and benefit society, and so I completed a PGCE in Secondary School Science, allowing me to teach the Sciences (biology, chemistry and physics) in secondary schools. This career was extremely intrinsically rewarding and I thoroughly enjoyed working and building the future generations. Whilst completing my PGCE I helped out in a Technology week in which I first was exposed to coding in the form of 'Scratch'.</p>
                    <p> Following this introduction to very very basic coding I have had a massive interest in understanding coding and the tech industry, building a custom PC and completing courses in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My long term plan is to build a successful software developing career with the end goal of being able to spread and impress a strong knowledge and passion in software development for future generations.</p>

            <h3>My Interests</h3>
                <div class="paraPic">
                    <div class="intText">
                        <p> Since a young age I have been an active individual, enjoying spending time and releasing energy in a positive way. I like to do this through attending the gym, playing rugby union, and casually playing tennis and squash with friends. I also enjoy going out for walks and exploring new places with my partner and friends either in the local area or travelling to new destinations at weekends.</p>
                        <p> Ontop of exploring places at a weekend I am keen to see much more of the world, as previously mentioned I began travelling in December 2019 (which was rather poorly timed with the pandemic) with the intentions of seeing New Zealand, South East Asia and Japan. As these plans got cut short I am excited for the future when I am able to return to the Southern Hemisphere and visit these countires.</p>
                        <p> Upon retunring to the UK whilst completing my PGCE, I developed an interest in computing and developing in which I customised a gaming PC and began learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp.org</a> and <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">PluralSight</a>. Following self-teaching myself main aspects of developing I began a [Re]Boot Course through Leeds Trinity University that is supported by the European Social Fund.</p>
